Proof Queries

Q1. The author names and surnames have been identified and spelled correctly.
Q2. The TOC text is as follows:

"This work studies the effect of displacing a single atomic monolayer on the linear optical properties of a material. The reflectance is calculated for a Si(111)(1x1):H slab after disordering individual atomic layers (see figure). This slab produces a larger reflectance than the unperturbed slab, and there are quantitative differences between the contribution from the even/odd layers."
