Dear Dr. Mendoza,

We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been accepted for
publication as a Regular Article in Physical Review B.  We would also
like to bring the appended referee comments to your attention.

Your manuscript will now be prepared for the production process.  If
any issues arise we will contact you; otherwise your manuscript will
be forwarded directly to our production department.  Please do not send
a revised manuscript or figures at this time unless requested.

Yours sincerely,

Athanasios Chantis

PUBLICITY AND OUTREACH:

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit a summary that clarifies
the new elements of the work and their expected impact. These summaries help
APS editors consider papers for coverage in the following venues:
	
- Physics (http://physics.aps.org): Daily online-only news and commentary about
  a selection of papers from the APS journal collection.

- Media tip sheets: News briefs distributed to credentialed journalists about
  forthcoming papers. 

- Editors' Suggestions: Papers that are judged to be particularly important,
  interesting, or well written are highlighted and prominently displayed on our
  journal websites. 

Summaries may also be distributed to other (non-APS) media outlets.

Guidelines for writing a publicity and outreach summary and how to submit it
can be found here:

COVERAGE BY YOUR NEWS OFFICE: 

Please inform your institution's public-information or news office as soon as
possible about this acceptance. This office may publish newsletters and reports
describing the institution's research or it may keep lists of papers published
in major journals.  In some cases the writers may want to publicize your work
with the local media, and they need as much lead time as possible.  To find the
appropriate office, try searching for your institution's name at
http://sciencesources.eurekalert.org or http://www.newswise.com/resources/ncd/.

Second Report of the First Referee -- BP12969/Anderson
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The revised manuscript has considered fairly all of the comments of 
the two referees, and implemented most of the suggested changes (as 
well as extra useful clarifications). The main request of Referee 2 
(the SSHG yield derivation) is now available on arXiv. I still think 
it is a pity that they chose not to show, or at least describe, the 
results (for 3-layer and 2-layer-bulk) for the Si(001)-(2x1) surface 
that they have carried out in response to my (Referee 1) comment, but 
I accept their motivations and will not insist on it. I recommend 
publication as is.
