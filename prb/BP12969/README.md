Improved ab initio calculation of surface second-harmonic generation from Si(111)(1x1):H
============================================

## Abstract
We carry out an improved ab initio calculation of surface second-harmonic
generation from the Si(111)(1x1):H surface. This calculation includes three
new features in one unique formulation: (i) the scissors correction, (ii) the
contribution of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, and (iii) the
inclusion of a cut function for extracting the surface response, all within
the independent particle approximation. We apply these improvements on the
Si(111)(1x1):H surface and compare with various experimental spectra from
several different sources. We also revisit the three layer model for the SHG
yield and demonstrate that it provides more accurate results over several,
more common, two layer models. We demonstrate the importance of using properly
relaxed coordinates for the theoretical calculations. Our comparisons also
indicate the effects of temperature, and surface adsorption on the
second-harmonic radiation yield. We conclude that this new approach to the
calculation of the second-harmonic spectra is versatile and accurate within
this level of approximation. This well-characterized surface offers an
excellent platform for comparison with theory, and allows us to offer this
study as an efficient benchmark for these types of calculations.
