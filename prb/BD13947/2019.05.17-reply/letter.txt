Report of the First Referee -- BD13947/Anderson
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Anderson, Mendoza, and Carriles present a first principles model of 
strain wave propagation through a Si(111):H slab and study how the 
linear optical reflectance changes as a result of a deep lying defect 
layer below the surface. The idea is to simulate the results of 
coherent phonon spectroscopy (CAP). The strain wave is modeled 
analytically and the optical response (change in reflectance) is 
computed in the independent particle picture. As both strain and light 
penetrate deeply into semiconductor slabs, and the the strain profile 
changes at each timestep, an ab initio approach is an ambitious 
undertaking. Here the authors use a very thick slab of 150 A, which 
forces them to use a 1x1 cell and thus consider a simple defect 
represented by a displacement of one atomic layer. The authors 
acknowledge this is an unrealistic situation to produce 
experimentally, and while localized/point defects are beyond 
treatment, their approach may work for buried interfaces, 
dislocations, thin films, and so on. The paper is well written, the 
figures are clear, the analysis of the obtained spectra is 
interesting, and the approach, to my eyes, looks reasonable. I 
recommend publication after the authors have considering the 
following: 

1. My main worry about the approach is that the final signal (fig 2 b) 
clearly reveals a new peak related to the defect, but does not seem 
sensitive enough to allow an experimentally measured defect position 
to be inferred (the differences between the various profiles is very 
small). The interesting change in reflectance with respect to the 
defect depth (Fig 4a) is I suppose integrated into the main peak in 
Fig 2b and thus the information is hidden. Is this correct? 

2. The reason for the different scissors shifts for surface and bulk 
is not clear to me. I suppose that for a slab as thick as the one used 
here, the size quantization is minimal and the bulk states are well 
represented. Also: 3.4eV refers to the direct gap, which should be 
noted. 

3. Can the authors explain the origin of the 2.8eV peak in terms of 
some localized defect state, rather than some general bond length 
argument? It may be useful to understand what kind of perturbation the 
approach is sensitive to. 

4. Note some typos: page 6 "present present" and "were we plot"

Report of the Second Referee -- BD13947/Anderson
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors present an original and well-written theoretical 
study on the influence of strain on surface optical properties. 
The work extends early research by Hingerl and co-workers on the 
influence of static strain [see, e.g., App. Surf. Sci. 175/176 
(2001) 769-776] (which probably should be cited in this context) 
to the dynamic range and points out an 
interesting application, the detection of buried defect layers.

The methodology is sound and the calculations are well done.
There is one point I do not understand, however. The authors 
write (page 3) "A scissors shift of 0.7 eV was used for the 
surface susceptibility, obtained from G0W0 calculations [58]; 
a scissors shift of 0.98 eV was used for the bulk calculation"
A scissors shift 0.98 eV is in fact very large for DFT 
calculations on silicon. In an previous calculation on the 
optical response of Si(111):H [Phys. Rev. B 61, 7604 (2000)]
a value of 0.5 eV was used. In Ref. [58] cited by the authors
a difference of 0.68 eV was found for bulk DFT and G0W0 
calculation. The authors should explain (i) how they arrived 
at the values of 0.7 and 0.98 eV and (ii) how they apply these
two different values to the calculation of the optical response.
Do they weight the shift according to the surface-localization
of the respective state?

Once this clarified, I suppose the paper will be suitable for 
publication.
